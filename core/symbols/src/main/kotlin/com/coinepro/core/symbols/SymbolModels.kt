 * client-side so the whole universe is usable the moment the symbol list arrives, rather than only
 * the handful anybody hand-listed.
 *
 * The three name fields are deliberately separate:
 *
 * * [symbol] is **identity**. It is the feed's own spelling, cleaned of punctuation and upper-cased,
 *   and it is what goes back on the wire. Nothing may substitute a prettier name for it.
 * * [canonical] is the same instrument under this app's preferred name — `GOLD` and `XAUUSD` are one
 *   market, and ranking, aliasing and artwork all key off this. It is never sent to a server.
 * * [description] is what a Persian reader sees.

     *
     * A pair's full description is two spelled-out currencies — «دلار آمریکا / فرانک سوئیس», twenty-
     * four characters — and no column narrow enough to leave room for a price will hold it. What
     * shipped first was every forex row ending in an ellipsis.
     *
     * The fix for *that* was to print the **base** alone, and it was wrong in a way the ellipsis at
     * least was not: USDJPY, USDCHF and USDCAD all came out «دلار آمریکا». Three instruments, one
     * subtitle, in the column whose entire job is telling them apart — and a reader seeing the same
     * words on three consecutive rows reads it as a bug, correctly.
     *
     * A pair is two things and the row has to say both, so both are said in the short names
     * [SymbolNames.shortDisplayOf] keeps: «دلار/ین» is seven characters and fits under any ticker.
     *
     * Everything else keeps its description, which is already short: a coin's is its name and its
     * ticker, an index's is its name.
     *
     * Search still matches on [description] — a reader typing «فرانک سوئیس» must still find USDCHF,
     * and would not if the long name had been dropped from the thing being searched rather than
     * from the thing being drawn.
